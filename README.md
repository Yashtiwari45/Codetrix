# Codetrix

### 🚀 About the Project
Codetrix is an **innovative web app** designed to make learning and practicing programming **more interactive and engaging**. Inspired by the **Ben 10 Omnitrix**, the landing page showcases **3D animated elements** that dynamically change and respond to user interactions.
