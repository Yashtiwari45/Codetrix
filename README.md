# Codetrix

Codetrix is an **innovative web app** designed for programming enthusiasts and learners. It offers a **visually immersive experience** inspired by the **Ben 10 Omnitrix**, featuring **interactive 3D elements** that change dynamically based on user interactions. 

The landing page acts as an intuitive **navigation system**, where users select various coding-related modules, represented as alien-like transformations. As they hover and click, the animations respond, making the experience **fluid and engaging**.

Beyond its unique design, Codetrix serves as a **learning companion** for students. Users can:
- Select a topic from **various programming categories**.
- Take **mock tests** to reinforce learning.
- Solve coding challenges with **automatic question generation** or custom problems.
- Use **test case validators, a built-in compiler, and an interactive solution checker**.
- Earn points and track progress based on difficulty levels (**Easy → Medium → Hard**).

Codetrix aims to **bridge the gap between learning and practical application**, helping students sharpen their skills in an interactive and rewarding way.
